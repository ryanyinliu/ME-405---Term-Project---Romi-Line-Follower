# ME 405 Term Project - Line Follower Robot


## Overview
This project involved the design and code implementation of a line-following robot based on the Romi chassis.

## Mechanical Setup
In this project we installed switch bump sensors, line sensors, and an IMU onto the Romi chassis. The bump sensors came with screws that went into mounting holes that lined up with the Romi chassis so we installed it by screwing it into place. The line sensor array lined up with to larger cutouts that allowed the pins to extend above the chassis for wire connection. We zip-tied the pins to standoffs to secure these sensors into place. The IMU was connected to a breadboard and double sided tape to secure it above the bump sensors. 

## Motor PID Control
The motor used a PID control algorithm to maintain a set speed. We began our controls design process by implementing the PID loop below. We derived the $K_P$ constant by using known information of the motor from the Pololu website and found $K_{ff}$, $K_D$ and $K_I$ through iteration.

$K_V = \frac{150RPM*\frac{2Î radians-minutes}{60seconds-revolutions}}{4.5V}$

$V_{battery} = 6*1.45V$

$\omega_{shaft} = K_V*V_{battery}$

$\omega_{wheel} = \frac{\omega_{shaft}}{120}$

$K_P = \frac{100}{\omega_{shaft}}$

$K_P = 3.293 [\frac{duty}{rad/s}]$


# Motor A Step Response
$K_{ff}=3.1, K_P=3.92, K_d = 0.00001, K_i = 10$

Our initial value for $K_{ff}$ resulted in a steady state error of around $0.79\frac{rad}{s}$ indicating that it is too low. Increasing the feed forward constant would increase the duty cycle sent to the motor and reduce steady state error. 

$K_{ff}=4.5, K_P=3.92, K_d=0.00001, K_i=10$

We increased $K_{ff}$ and found that there was negligible steady state error in our step response. The motor speed remained steady with minor oscillations around the set-point. 

$K_{ff}=4.5, K_P=20, K_d=0.00001, K_i=10$

Through iterating on $K_P$ we noticed that the motor oscillated and produced an underdamped response. 

$K_{ff}=4.5, K_P=3.92, K_d=0.001, K_i=10$

Iterating on the derivative constant $K_d$ lead to a similar underdamped response.

# Motor B Step Response

$K_{ff}=3.3, K_P=3.92, K_d=0.00001, K_i=10$

![Screenshot 2024-12-11 163132.jpg](e6a71c96-6de5-48a3-8113-4f8ec89304b8.jpg)

Our initial feed forward constant $K_{ff}$ produced a steady state error of $2\frac{rad}{s}$. In order to reduce the steady state error, we can increase the feed forward constant so that motor B experiences a higher duty cycle. 

$K_{ff}=4.6, K_P=3.92, K_d=0.00001, K_i=10$

Increasing $K_{ff}$ resulted in negligible steady state error and a steady motor speed. The feed forward constant was different than motor A which can be attributed to differences between the motor constants of the two motors. 

$K_{ff}=4.6, K_P=20, K_d=0.00001, K_i=10$

![Screenshot 2024-12-11 163356.jpg](c77570ed-8a36-48fc-be67-a1fb181fc9fe.jpg)

We increased $K_P$ and observed an underdamped step response where the motor speed oscillated around $13.5\frac{rad}{s}$.

$K_{ff}=4.6, K_P=3.92, K_d=0.001, K_i=10$

Through testing different PID and $K_{ff}$ constants, we found that these constants produced the least steady state error:

Motor A: $K_{ff}=4.5, K_P=3.92, K_d=0.00001, K_i=10$

Motor B: $K_{ff}=4.6, K_P=3.92, K_d=0.00001, K_i=10$
